        My name is Stephen Kaczmarowski and I graduated Northern Arizona University with a
        Bachelor's in Microbiology and minoring in Chemistry. During COVID, I started
        learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through Udemy, and quickly enveloped my time
        learning these technologies.

        I have always been a creator at heart; woodworking, music production, and software
        development is no different. I love being able to create projects, applications, and
        work through my code like a puzzle, making sure each piece is in place.

        There is still so much to learn, and I am excited to grow my skills in tech for
        a long time.

            New song, 'warp.' out now! Listen to it on SoundCloud or
            on Spotify now. This was my first release ever under the name
            Kaz, and I didn't know what to think of it. I didn't know if
            it was ready, if it was a stupid idea, or if I wasn't ready
            to upload my art into the real world. It has gone through
            some changes at the beginning, but it was officially released.
            Enjoy!

            Throughout the years, I feel like I've gone to so many different
            shows, seen so many different artists, met so many amazing people,
            and have had so many different experiences. I truly haven't really
            found anything else like them in the world. The crazy culture
            behind it, a weekend of drinking and your favorite artists, people
            to see for the first time, etc. There really is nothing like it.

            I think when I finally am settled into my career, get a truck,
            have a little camping setup in the back, I'm pretty much complete
            for camping festivals... pretty exciting when you think about it!
